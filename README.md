Mike Dad Bab Clock
=============

Chrome extension that replicate's Don Cherry's attempt to pronounce Mike Babcock's name on your machine,
replacing 'Babcock' with 'Dad Bab Clock'. I tell 'ya, boy.

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_
extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.

Installation
=============
In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Drag mdbc.crx into the page that appears.
