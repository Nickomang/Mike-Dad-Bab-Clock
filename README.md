Mike Dad Bab Clock
=============

Chrome extension that replicate's Don Cherry's attempt to pronounce Mike Babcock's name on your machine,
replacing 'Babcock' with 'Dad Bab Clock'. I tell 'ya, boy.

For those that don't understand, Hockey Night in Canada's legendary Don Cherry is famous for blundering names. His
pronounciation of Detroit coach Mike Babcock's name was horrendous, can be seen in [this tweeet](https://twitter.com/GoalieWays/status/601379857436700673)
and was briefly trendy to use on [/r/hockey](http://reddit.com/r/hockey).
